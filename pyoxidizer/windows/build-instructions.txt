Build requires Windows 10

1) Modify the pyoxidizer.bzl file with the new version number

2) Run:
pyoxidizer build --release

3) After build is complete, you will find the MSI package under the "build"
   folder. You can also zip the files under "staged_files" to create a
   manual install archive.
